I guess in thone is never to mention such things. Well, that is just a part of me. Once I get a job and begin mixing with intelligent people, for the first timyears, I'm sure that I'll bounce right back. I always do.",

I had gotten away from that and had been hiding from the fact that that is what God has put me on this earth to do for a living. What stresses me out the most is the idea of not being able to find a job developing programs.",

The second week my computer completely borked, it had been randomly rebooting but now this had become just too often. I attempted to erase the drive and reinstall everything and it shutdown before I could even finish reinstalling all the dev tools. I picked up a loaner from A-Inc and struggled. Between updating software and coding problems I never completed near as many stories as I felt I should have. This put me WAY behind.",

The ability to use one language to write a program which can run on desktop computers, Android phones, as well as Apple phones and computers is too great to be ignored.

That has been a total disaster. I can't seem to get anything to work and waste hours trying to get code to work in the wrong file or in the wrong manner.  This leaves me mentally exhausted to the point that I can't keep track of what I'm trying to do. A total waste of my and my instructor's time. I've spent two entire days trying to display a TicTacToe board using two loops and don't have a single line of code to show for my effort.",

Several times the sound went out or it shut down due to either the heat or problems caused by the heat. I reset the PRAM and SMC chips several times and left it shutdown overnight. Saturday it gave me only one problem and Sunday it overheated only once. I performed the built in hardware diagnostics check twice without any problems being found. I'm still worried.",

That really got the anger whipped up so I could make rate, keep my job and feed my family. Although extremely frustrated and totally pessimistic at the moment I also feel more alive than I have felt in years. Programming is what God made me for.
