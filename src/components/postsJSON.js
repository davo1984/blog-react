I attempted to erase the drive and reinstall everything and it shut down before I could even finish reinstalling all the dev tools. I picked up a loaner from Awesome Inc and struggled.

That has been a total disaster. I can't seem to get anything to work and waste hours trying to get code to work in the wrong file or in the wrong manner. This leaves me mentally exhausted to the point that I can't keep track of what I'm trying to do. A total waste of my and my instructor's time.

Lastly a bug tracking system is always a good thing to program because every firm I would be seeking employment with has one and knows how they should work.
